= Setting up MSSQL Server on Kubernetes

These are my notes on deploying a simple (non-production ready instance) of MS SQL Server into Kubernetes. These steps will walk through how to
create the MS SQL Server pod and then use a service to expose that service. In my specific use-case, I wanted to setup MS SQL Server so I could
deploy Spring Cloud Data Flow into my cluster. The instructions in this recipe are specific to this use-case but can be easily adapted for other
use-cases.

== MS SQL Server Pod & Service Definition

The deployment yaml for this tutorial is located in the same folder as this document and is called `mssql-deployment.yaml`. 

=== MS SQL Server Pod

The pod is the container that hosts the MS SQL server instance. The pod uses the official container provided from Microsoft and is NOT
setup with persistent storage.

.MS SQL Server Pod Defintion
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  labels:
    app: mssql # <1>
  name: mssql
spec:
  containers:
  - image: mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server # <2>
    name: mssql
    #Environment Variables
    env:
    - name: ACCEPT_EULA
      value: "Y"
    - name: SA_PASSWORD
      value: "Your_password123" # <3>
    - name: MSSQL_PID
      value: Developer # <4>
    #Map the standard mssql server Port.
    ports:
    - name: mssql-port
      containerPort: 1433 # <5>
----
<1> The label being applied to our pod is `app=msslq` and this will be used in the selector of the service.
<2> The image of MS SQL Server that will be downloaded and then deployed into Kubernetes.
<3> The password rules for MS SQL Server require the password to be 8 characters, include upper/lowercase letters and a number or symbol.
<4> The MSSQL PID is "Developer" which I *think* is like a license?
<5> The container port for MSSQL server.

WARNING: The container will not start if the password used in the deployment descriptor violates the MS SQL Server password rules.
The password must be at least 8 characters in lenth, include upper/lowercase letters, and include either a number or symbol. I initial
used a password suffiexd with exclaimation point `!` and it was not working as expected. This might have to do with YAML Parser, just be aware.


=== Exposing MS SQL Server via a Service

The service is used to define an end point that allows an external client (like Azure Data Studio) to connect to the database. Additionally,
the service also provides an internal Cluster IP that allows containers within Kubernetes to connect to the pod.

.MS SQL Server Service Defintion
[source,yaml]
----
#Service Setup:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mssql-server <1>
spec:
  # NodePort exposea s port on the kubernetes node to the outside world
  # and creates an internal cluster IP for the services as well.
  type: NodePort <2>
  #Map the internal pod port to port 31433 on the cluster.
  ports:
  - name: 31433-1433
    nodePort: 31433
    port: 1433
  # Selector uses label app=mssql
  selector:
    app: mssql <3>
----
<1> The name of the service, also becomes the dns name that can be used internally to access ms sql server.
<2> The service type is defined as a NodePort so we can expose a port on the Kubernetes node so external clients can connect to the database.
This also implicitly creates a cluser IP.
<3> The selector "app=mssql" is used to map this service to the underlying pod.


=== Apply the deployment on the cluster

The pod and the service can be created on the cluster by using the command: 

`kubectl apply -f mssql-deployment.yaml`

The logs within the MS SQL Server pod can be viewed using:

`kubectl logs mssql`

== Preparing MS SQL Server For Use

The spring cloud data flow infrastructure uses a relational database to store information about executed instances and job information.
This section outlines how to create a database within SQL Server and then creating a database user that has acceess to that database.

=== Connecting to the database with Azure Data Studio

The kubernetes service has been setup to expose the database the port 31433 on the Kubernetes node. This allows external clients to connect
and use the database. In my case, I am using the kubernetes cluster that is included with docker desktop and I can use `localhost` as my server.
The port, `31433` can be configured usig the "Advanced..." button. Initially, we will connect using the user `sa` and the password used in the pod definition.

=== Create a database and user

We need to create a database and user within SQL Server that can be used to host the schema for dataflow and skipper. This can be done by logging
into the database as the `sa` user and executing the following: 

.Database Creation
----
create database dataflow

EXEC sp_configure 'CONTAINED DATABASE AUTHENTICATION', 1;
RECONFIGURE;
USE [master];
ALTER DATABASE [dataflow] SET CONTAINMENT = PARTIAL;
----

.Schema Creation
----
-- This must be executed by itself.
use [dataflow];
create schema task;
----

.User Creation
----
use [dataflow];
create schema task;

create login dataflow with password = 'Coolpass1!'
create user dataflow for login dataflow with default_schema=task;
grant control on schema :: task to dataflow;
----
